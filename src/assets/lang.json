        "story-18-10" : "You grasp Nuka to your chest, calming her panic. You swear that Kade will fall by your hand, she can barely contain her joy. She squeezes her whole body against you, pressing her breasts to your abdomen, and you feel the warmth of her crotch on your thigh.",

        "story-110-10" : "You stifle a laugh. The thought of a “forest dominion” is a bit too adorable for the moment, but you manage to draw your weapon confidently enough. Nuka and Selena draw theirs in reply.",

        "story-111-12" : "Right on. Hey, if you need any help, let me know. I'm something of a mercenary myself. I'll basically do ANYthing for the right amount of gold.",
        "story-111-13" : "You tell Suzume thanks, but you're short of coin. You're actually not sure if you are or not, but you've never paid for war or sex, and you're not starting now. ",

        "story-111-15" : "She bites her lip, and winks. What she lacks in subtlety, she makes up for with clearly excellent communication skills. ",

        "story-112-1" : "The forest is fully restored now, and a cheerful wind whistles through the trees. More “tree news” you wonder? Is this what trees sound like having sex?",

        "story-112-5" : "A few ideas spring to mind, so you whisper them into her ear. You actually have to invent a few new words, such is your creativity. ",
        "story-112-6" : "Nuka flushes pink, and stifles a giggle-laugh. ",
        "story-112-7" : "You make sure to add that Selena helped too. Teamwork and all that.",
        "story-112-8" : "Think nothing of it. Though I've certainly thought of a few ways you can show your appreciation. ",
        "story-112-9" : "Nuka turns a deeper shade of red. She touches her bottom lip, absentmindedly. You've seen this look before - she can't help but wear her desires on her face. ",
        "story-112-10" : "That... All sounds pretty exciting.",
        "story-112-11" : "You watch a bead of sweat drip from her eyebrow and fall upon her cleavage, and quickly slide between her breasts. You imagine there's a few things you'd like to slide in there. ",
        "story-112-12" : "Goodness, my lord. Has it grown hotter, suddenly? Or is it just me?",
        "story-112-13" : "You assure Nuka that she's hot, drawing a little closer. Her breathing quickens, and your closeness makes her redder still. ",
        "story-112-14" : "Our lord speaks true, little Shaman. Your hotness is no matter of debate.  ",
        "story-112-15" : "But your first guess may have also been accurate. For it is indeed hotter, as we have reached a great desert. ",
        "story-112-16" : "You look up. Before you, a vast barren desert stretches as far as the eye can see.",

        "story-116-15" : "Huh. Well, that's rather annoying. I'm pretty much the finest healer in these parts. I was certain my reputation would precede me.   ",
        "story-116-16" : "Selena eyes the spell books warily, but Nuka steps forward. She hugs her staff to her breasts, and can barely contain her excitement. ",
        "story-116-17" : "You obviously know a lot about magic! We could use someone like you on our team. Would you join our cause? Oh please say yes!",
        "story-116-18" : "A complex mix of irritation and intrigue dance on her face, and Althea ponders for a few moments while sizing you up. ",
        "story-116-19" : "You cough, and do your best to put your best foot forward. And by foot, you mean cock. ",
        "story-116-20" : "Well, I was getting a little bored of my books. Maybe you could teach me a thing or two. Let me consider it...",


        "story-117-1" : "The sun continues to beat down on your party like bright bukkake. Frankly, there's just a little bit too much sweat on your nuts for your liking. ",
        "story-117-2" : "I never thought I would say this... But I think I'm just a little too hot.",
        "story-117-3" : "Steel thyself, little Shaman. We are nearly through the desert. The end is in sight.",
        "story-117-4" : "Selena points to the horizon, where a line of treetops cuts between land and sky. The sight makes you downright hard, to be honest. ",
        "story-117-5" : "Hooray! We're saved! ",
        "story-117-6" : "You swallow a whole lot of curse words and get back to trudging through sand. Briefly, you mutter something about how coarse and rough it is. ",
        "story-117-7" : "I wonder if that healer knew the direction of this forest?",
        "story-117-8" : "You mean, like, she knew and didn't offer to guide us? That would be incredibly rude!",
        "story-117-9" : "Nuka pouts, and despite the ball sweat and sand in your trousers, you suddenly can imagine nothing else but softly sucking on that lip.",
        "story-117-10" : "You assure Nuka that when next you meet Althea, you'll indeed teach her a few lessons in “sharing”. ",
        "story-117-11" : "Let's focus on the task at hand. The sooner we cross this desert, the sooner I can wash away the sand in my... boots.",


        "story-120-1" : "Beneath the shade of its canopy, the forest is cool relief. Just then, it strikes you just how much you like forests. Man, are forests just the best.",
        "story-120-2" : "Yay! We made it! This is certainly more like it.",
        "story-120-3" : "Nuka plops down onto the forest floor and writhes happily on the grass and leaves, scooping some up to rub them over her body.",
        "story-120-4" : "Oh, I could just stay here forever!",
        "story-120-5" : "We should keep moving. This isn't a defendable position.",
        "story-120-6" : "But we've traveled so far, and fought so hard. Surely we deserve at least a little break? Right, my lord?",
        "story-120-7" : "Looking around, there really isn't an inch of forest you don't want to press Nuka and Selena against and screw their brains out. But night is falling fast, and for once your brain takes the wheel away from your cock. ",
        "story-120-8" : "We should be through this forest by nightfall, should nothing get in our way.",
        "story-120-9" : "Umm...",
        "story-120-10" : "Nuka points into the depths of the woods, where a giant ram stands glaring at you. Let me repeat that - a giant ram is staring you down from the foliage. Gods damn it.",
        "story-120-11" : "He's roughly the size of a horse, and looks mean. He paws the earth, and snorts angrily. Again - it's a giant ram. Looks like Fate is just out to dick you today. ",
        "story-120-12" : "Selena unsheathes her sword. The ring of metal brings you back to your senses. ",
        "story-120-13" : "Look alive, you two! This is no time to get sheepish!",
        "story-120-14" : "No! He's a child of the forest! We can't hurt him!",
        "story-120-15" : "The ram charges the three of you. Selena grabs Nuka by the waist and lifts her to safety. ",
        "story-120-16" : "Nuka quickly grabs her staff with a few flourishing spins.",
        "story-120-17" : "Okay, well, maybe we can hurt him. Just this once.",
        "story-120-18" : "Orders, my lord? It's time to sheer this beast down to size!",


        "story-121-1" : "The forest is silent. Quiet and still as death. Here, even the birds do not sing. Nuka trembles. Somehow, she even does that kinda sexy. ",
        "story-121-2" : "Something still isn't right. I can feel it... Everywhere. Deep in my heart, and my...",
        "story-121-3" : "We should press on. I have no wish to spend the night in a place such as this. Or the day, if I'm being honest.",
        "story-121-4" : "You continue on, but a sound at last rises from the deafness. A low voice is coming from a dense thicket not far from the path. You assume it's the plot, finally caught up to you.",
        "story-121-5" : "My lord, I must insist we make a tree, and...",
        "story-121-6" : "You raise your hand, ignoring Selena's wisdom in favor of some action. You plunge through the brush and into a small clearing. A woman with long silver hair is kneeling next to a babbling brook, chanting seemingly in reply.",
        "story-121-7" : "Lacking a better introduction, you clear your throat. But you try your best to make it sound all raspy and cool. The woman glances up to you, startled, her eyes glowing red with magical power.",
        "story-121-8" : "You have interrupted my ritual.",
        "story-121-9" : "Her voice has a bit too much reverb for your comfort, so you apologize and introduce the rest of the party. As you stumble your way through it, the woman stands to full height. She is nearly as tall as you.",
        "story-121-10" : "There is no need to apologize, my lord. I know who you are. My name is Roxelana, and I foresaw your coming. ",
        "story-121-11" : "She gestures to the spring, and its surface shimmers with her magic. ",
        "story-121-12" : "You saw us cumming?!",
        "story-121-13" : "Other kind. Not the sexy kind. ",
        "story-121-14" : "Oh.",
        "story-121-15" : "The priestess steps in front of you, and softly strokes your face. Just from this your knees almost buckle, and something like a surge of lightning briefly courses through your cock. She smiles. You smile. Smiling is nice. ",
        "story-121-16" : "You are indeed the hero who will save us all, my lord. Though your quest is difficult, it is not beyond your grasp. Find your courage, and you will triumph. ",
        "story-121-17" : "With a head full of clouds and a cock full of lightning, you ask Roxelana to join your cause. But she laughs.",
        "story-121-18" : "I must finish my task here, my lord. But if you find yourself in the depths of peril, call for me. If I deem your need great, I may come.",
        "story-121-19" : "You might cum? ",
        "story-121-20" : "No. You did it again.",
        "story-121-21" : "Man, I've got just a one track mind today.",
        "story-121-22" : "Roxelana bows to you, then returns to kneeling by the brook to complete her ritual. You can't help but note once she's kneeling that her height would be perfect for a completely different ritual. Seeming to sense your thoughts, she laughs softly.",
        "story-121-23" : "Be on your way, my lord. Gods speed you.",


        "story-124-1" : "The forest finally gives way to foothills, and soon you find yourself trekking through deep snow. This must be the snow level.",
        "story-124-2" : "You notice that neither Selena nor Nuka are dressed for cold weather. And that they both have really nice tits. Selena seems to detect your concern.",
        "story-124-3" : "Fear not, my lord. I'm sure we'll face another fight soon. I need only the heat of battle to keep me warm.",
        "story-124-4" : "And if that doesn't work, I can think of a few other ways to keep us nice and toasty.",
        "story-124-5" : "Nuka giggles, and continues to lead. A spell from her staff blowing the snow drifts from the path ahead. You briefly wonder why that wouldn't have worked as a fan in the desert heat...",
        "story-124-6" : "I like the snow! It reminds me of the winter solstice!",
        "story-124-7" : "She takes a deep breath, but then coughs and wrinkles her nose.",
        "story-124-8" : "Yuck! There's something nasty up ahead. And that's saying something, because I like most smells and not everything in the forest smells like daisies. ",
        "story-124-9" : "There are many foul terrors in these mountains, little Shaman. Best to keep our eyes, and noses, sharp.",
        "story-124-10" : "I smell a rat.",
        "story-124-11" : "Well, some of our foes are quite devious. But I don't think you have anything to fear in our present company...",
        "story-124-12" : "No. Literally a rat. So much eww! I mean, I love nature and all, but rats are creepy little pus bags. With their little thumbs, and naked tails, and enormous butts...",
        "story-124-13" : "You consider launching into a friendly debate, complete with thematic overtones, about the power of empathy and compassion. But frankly rats are gross, and worth experience points. Fuck ‘em. You order Nuka forward.",
        "story-124-14" : "As you wish my lord! But I hope we can avoid that rat. The trees tend to frown on exploding the heads of tiny forest-dwelling creatures...",


        "story-127-1" : "Heavy snow blows amidst your company. Nuka's magic is no longer strong enough to hold the storm at bay, and you've gotten the rare chance to remember what it feels like when your nose hairs freeze. ",
        "story-127-2" : "Nuka is shaking with cold, and your fingers have begun to numb. Even Selena looks pretty chilly, with a dire case of frozen-bitch-face, as she bravely plows through the drifts. ",
        "story-127-3" : "D-d-don't worry ab-b-bout me! I'lll b-b-be fine!",
        "story-127-4" : "Selena pulls you close.",
        "story-127-5" : "My lord, I fear for Nuka. She is too small and squishy to endure these conditions...",
        "story-127-6" : "Hey! I c-c-can hear you! Who are you c-c-calling small and squishy?",
        "story-127-7" : "Nuka sneezes, and her hair frosts with icicles. ",
        "story-127-8" : "Okay. I m-m-might be getting a l-l-little chilly.",
        "story-127-9" : "Out of nowhere, a ball of fire arcs through the air and crashes into a nearby snowbank. A tiny fairy, clad in orange with wings of flame, pulls herself from the crater. It's metal as hell.",
        "story-127-10" : "Did someone say “chili”?",
        "story-127-11" : "Yes! I d-d-did! I'm extremely chilly!",
        "story-127-12" : "Oh. Bummer. I thought you meant, like, chili. I could go for a bowl right now. Though by the looks of things, I wouldn't mind eating you! ",
        "story-127-13" : "I'm Agni. I'm from around here. You're not, obviously. You're dressed like tourists. Did you notice how cold it is?",
        "story-127-14" : "Selena steps forward, looming over the fairy. ",
        "story-127-15" : "We noticed, little fiery one. ",
        "story-127-16" : "Hey! Who are YOU calling “little”, you big cunt!",
        "story-127-17" : "Right?! She calls me little all the time!",
        "story-127-18" : "Well, I was going to offer to help, but since you're clearly racist against fireflies...",
        "story-127-19" : "You interrupt the showdown with a moving and well-rehearsed speech on the perils of racism. It's something you've trained for since your youth, just in case you ever wanted to seduce one of those warriors of social justice. Then you invite Agni to join your cause.",
        "story-127-20" : "Hmmm. Tempting, but I dunno. Let me think about it. Maybe I'll see you later. Maybe I won't.",
        "story-127-21" : "With a flick of her fingers, she disappears in a plume of smoke. Metal. As. Hell.",


        "story-130-1" : "Nuka's humming is an interesting mix of patience-testing and sexiness, somehow. You've been listening to it for a couple hours uninterrupted, so you notice immediately when she goes silent.",
        "story-130-2" : "Um, my lord?",
        "story-130-3" : "She points to a large set of mega-creepy footprints in the freshly fallen snow. ",
        "story-130-4" : "I think we've got trouble. Or a wicked prank. Are we being pranked?",
        "story-130-5" : "You and Selena kneel over the prints, trying to discern what kind of creature left them. You're not sure why you're trying so hard though - you can't track worth crap.",
        "story-130-6" : "These marks are similar to a Manticore's, my lord.",
        "story-130-7" : "You shake your head. Though honestly your first guess was unicorn, so maybe you should cool it with the criticism. ",
        "story-130-8" : "Nuka tugs on your sleeve. ",
        "story-130-9" : "My lord?",
        "story-130-10" : "You wave her off, still considering the prints. Maybe a snake of some kind?",
        "story-130-11" : "Perhaps a bear? But like, a really creepy bear? ",
        "story-130-12" : "Um, you guys...?",
        "story-130-13" : "At a certain angle, they sort of look like reindeer? Maybe pulling a sleigh of some kind? You're about to voice this opinion, when Nuka's protests become much louder and urgent.",
        "story-130-14" : "My lord! I think it might be a rat!",
        "story-130-15" : "Little shaman - rats are very small and these prints are very large. Maybe a whole bunch of rats moving single file to hide their numbers? Or a BIG ass rat...",
        "story-130-16" : "EXACTLY! LOOK!",
        "story-130-17" : "Nuka points up the path, where an enormous rat is crouched, ready to attack. Its eyes are red, and its fangs drip with gingivitis. Briefly, you wonder why Nuka said she only “thought” it was a rat. It's clearly a rat.",
        "story-130-18" : "Damn it!",
        "story-130-19" : "I fucking knew it!",


        "story-131-1" : "Your band celebrates. For a moment you consider that this, your most glorious moment so far, is for defeating a rat. But then you kick the rat again in its stupid head. ",
        "story-131-2" : "Whoo hoo! Take that you dirty rat! ",
        "story-131-3" : "Selena smiles at Nuka's excitement, and shoots you a sly smile. ",
        "story-131-4" : "I think, perhaps, you are her hero, my lord. Should we skin the rat for a trophy, perhaps?",
        "story-131-5" : "You laugh, and congratulate them both on a job well done. There are hugs and butt squeezes galore. ",
        "story-131-6" : "We should celebrate! Anyone got a bottle of mead stashed away? I feel like I'm invincible right now!",
        "story-131-7" : "Alas, not to be the party killer, but we should move on. We were in the middle of freezing to death. That's still an issue.",
        "story-131-8" : "You note the clouds overhead growing more dark and ominous, and the wind is whipping snow in your eyes. For once, you don't feel like banging. It's that bad.",
        "story-131-9" : "Once we pass through this mountain range, the weather should improve. Then we can avoid dying. I'm allergic to dying.",
        "story-131-10" : "Then can we celebrate? ",
        "story-131-11" : "You mention that celebrating is easier when your digits and naughty bits aren't frozen. You promise time for a little rest and relaxation as soon as it proves non-life-threatening.",
        "story-131-12" : "Nuka hikes up her panties, and plows forward through the snow covered path.",


        "story-133-1" : "As your trek continues, the clouds part momentarily and expose the sun like an enormous shimmering ball. You and your allies pause momentarily to admire the view.",
        "story-133-2" : "A snowball interrupts the moment, careening with the back of Selena's head. You can't help but reply with, “baaaaaaaaaam!” ",
        "story-133-3" : "What in the hells---?",
        "story-133-4" : "Nuka laughs merrily at Selena, her voice musical and delighted, until another snowball smacks her in the face. ",
        "story-133-5" : "Ouch! Hey! Who threw that? Cut it out!",
        "story-133-6" : "A tiny girl with blue hair and a delicate body slides into view from further up the mountain. She giggles, her voice as clear as ringing metal. ",
        "story-133-7" : "Oh! I wish you could pluck your eyes out and see your own faces! Priceless!",
        "story-133-8" : "Selena takes a step forward and looms her armored breasts above the girl's head, menacingly.",
        "story-133-9" : "Perhaps we can substitute something a little more serious than snowballs. What was that about plucking out eyes?",
        "story-133-10" : "Coral immediately stops laughing. She takes a deep breath, but you notice her breath doesn't fog in the cold air.",
        "story-133-11" : "Sorry. Didn't mean any harm. People just haven't seemed to be much for fun, since the Dark Wizard took over...",
        "story-133-12" : "She reaches into her satchel and pulls out a handful of popsicles. ",
        "story-133-13" : "Peace offering? I make'em myself! Don't ask how...",
        "story-133-14" : "Nuka, permanently shivering now, eyes the treats with suspicion. ",
        "story-133-15" : "N-n-no thank you. Let me know if you have any soup in that satchel...",
        "story-133-16" : "Nuka's lips are growing as blue as Coral's... everything. Selena urges the party forward, putting her arm around the little Shaman. ",
        "story-133-17" : "You turn to Coral and gratefully take a popsicle. You declare that, if she is as good with her weapon as she is with her snowballs, she should join your cause. ",
        "story-133-18" : "Coral looks tempted but declines. ",
        "story-133-19" : "I'm just an apprentice, my lord. But if my master gives me permission, I'd be happy to join you! I shall seek his word, and pray our paths cross again!",
        "story-133-20" : "Coral waves at your band as you continue to push into the mountains. As you continue, you bring the popsicle to your lips, and are rather surprised by the flavor...",


        "story-135-1" : "At last you reach the summit of the mountain range, and swear to the gods that you'll never step foot in a snow level ever again. Just as you crest the final ridge though, you see a tall woman standing on the edge of a jagged cliff, the wind ripping at her purple robes. ",
        "story-135-2" : "She is holding a staff and chanting a spell. She too does not appear to know how to dress for the weather. ",
        "story-135-3" : "Greetings, stranger. Well met.",
        "story-135-4" : "The woman turns to you for a moment, surveying the three of you with mysterious purple eyes. Then she turns her back and returns to conjuring. ",
        "story-135-5" : "Whoa, that was rude! Does everyone on this mountain have an icicle shoved up their nethers? Hey! We're talking to you!",
        "story-135-6" : "The woman turns again, piqued by Nuka's boldness. All around the raging blizzard subsides, turning into a gentle snowfall. The wind calms, and no longer appears to be trying to disrobe the woman. ",
        "story-135-7" : "Who dares speak so boldly in my presence? You lack not for courage, stupidity, or both.",
        "story-135-8" : "You introduce yourself and confirm that your party lacks not for courage or stupidity. You tell her of your quest, all the while mentally undressing her. You've really got a thing for girls with horns, you are surprised to learn. The woman remains unimpressed.",
        "story-135-9" : "What concern is your quest to me? ",
        "story-135-10" : "You'll be concerned enough when the Dark Wizard comes for you. He's the sort who mind-controls on the first date.",
        "story-135-11" : "Don't make me laugh. I would love to see him try.",
        "story-135-12" : "Edana raises her hand, and the blizzard instantly returns. ",
        "story-135-13" : "Hey! Are you the one causing this storm?",
        "story-135-14" : "Perhaps. Do you have difficulty parsing the obvious?",
        "story-135-15" : "Why would you do that? You can't control nature, mage. This is mega uncool.",
        "story-135-16" : "I do what I want. Now move along, before I start feeling mind-control-ly. ",
        "story-135-17" : "You turn to leave, but Nuka stands her ground. She puffs up her chest and her lips tighten into a grim frown. It actually kind of turns you on, and you start feeling like your old self. ",
        "story-135-18" : "Well, I'm freezing my butt off. What say you to knocking off the drama llama snowstorm until we're off this mountain?",
        "story-135-19" : "Prithee.",
        "story-135-20" : "Surprisingly, a small smile bends the corners of Edana's mouth. She seems amused, and she twirls her hair in contemplation. ",
        "story-135-21" : "Very well, shaman. I'll quell the storm until you have managed safe passage. I wouldn't want a butt such as yours to freeze off. Safe travels.",
        "story-135-22" : "Nuka's face blooms into a warm smile.",
        "story-135-23" : "Wow! Thanks a million!",
        "story-135-24" : "Listen mage - we could use one such as you in our quest against the the Dark Wizard. Feel like tempting Fate?",
        "story-135-25" : "But Edana doesn't answer. She softly caresses her throat as she watches you leave, and you swear she licks her lips in a most familiar way before you lose sight of her.",


        "story-137-1" : "The sun is sparkling on the rolling hills of snow, and the warmth is a welcomed change of pace. ",
        "story-137-2" : "While you're pondering the logistics of building an anatomically correct snowman, a loud crack splits the air. Like thunder, it rolls across the mountain range, but the sky is cloudless. ",

        "story-137-4" : "Selena points to a cliff high above, where a plume of blue smoke is rising like an erratic phantom into the sky.",

        "story-137-6" : "Avalanche!",
        "story-137-7" : "You and Selena scoop Nuka up and rush back the way you came. You narrowly avoid boulders and the cascade of snow, as Nuka cannot help but yip and cheer with excitement.",
        "story-137-8" : "At last the rumbling stops, and the three of you make it to safety. Nuka's eyes are still wide and wild, and you're not entirely sure that this latest brush with death hasn't turned her on once again.",
        "story-137-9" : "Now what in the name of all the trees is that...",
        "story-137-10" : "You tell her it's an avalanche. Because you're both useful and a jackass. Nuka rolls her eyes and sticks out her tongue.",
        "story-137-11" : "Not that, my lord. THAT!",
        "story-137-12" : "You turn on heel and look to where she's pointing. High on the hill, riding the tail end of the avalanche, is an orange haired girl dressed all in red. She pulls a decent frontside indy to noseblunt - made all the more impressive by the fact that she's using a plank of wood for a board. ",
        "story-137-13" : "The girl sprays your party with a large heap of snow as she stops, before stepping on her board and flipping it across her shoulder.",
        "story-137-14" : "Are you mad? Have you lost track of your senses? ",
        "story-137-15" : "The girl shrugs. You immediately recognize someone who's really really good at shrugging. ",

Days of hard travel, furious battle, sleeping on rocks, cactus spines in your ass, blue-balling angels, giant rats, giant rats with wings, desert sweat on your balls, and so many sexy women coming and going.",
        "story-160-22" : "You can feel a fire within you. It's been so long since you took Nuka at the Lake of Life and filled her with your seed. And you know that that moment will pale in comparison to the full might of your sexual frustration. And it will be a fine thing.",

        "story-197-3" : "Selena shakes her head and points at scorch marks in the green grass.",

        "story-1100-3" : "We could use Zera in this fight. What did she say about fighting fire with fire?",
        "story-1100-4" : "As if on cue, you hear a mighty roar behind you. Out of the sandstorm comes charging an overgrown reptile. A dragon, its sharp fangs snapping as it approaches.",
        "story-1100-5" : "Stay together. If the storm gets worse, we could get separated and that thing could pick us off one by one. ",
        "story-1100-6" : "The dragon beats its mighty wings. A spray of wind and sand hits you in the eyes. Nuka cries out but stands firm.",

        "story-41-13" : "My Liege, I... You're right, I deserve to be punished.",
        "story-41-14" : "It's then that you notice that Helen doesn't look apologetic in the slightest. In fact, it seems as though she likes what's going on.",

        "story-51-4" : "The warrior's submissiveness was quite the opposite of her normal demeanor, and it was more than enough to cause your massive cock to grow to full mast and begin to throb.",
        "story-51-5" : "You tell Helen that, while her punishment was by no means over, she had done well, so she deserved some sort of reward.",
        "story-51-6" : "Yes... my Liege. Thank you...",

        "story-51-8" : "Yes... Master.",
        "story-51-9" : "Master. That was definitely a word you could get used to. You fit the collar around Helen's neck, wrap the cord around one of your hands, and tell her to lean against the cell walls.",

        "story-51-12" : "You grab onto Helen's hips and tell her to prepare herself, because just as quickly as you started, you begin to piston yourself in and out, never allowing yourself to fully leave her chasm.",

        "story-51-15" : "You start to pull on her collar slightly. This was supposed to be a punishment!",

        "story-51-20" : "As you release your seed deep inside of the warrior, you start to pull yourself out.",
